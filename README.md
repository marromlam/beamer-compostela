This theme is under development so, use it at your own risk!

The main picture of this theme was taken by me during the 2019 Feast of the Ascension over the  cantilevered observation wheel in A Alamenda Park. The picture has not a very good resolution (sorry!). I was planning to reshoot it in 2020, but covid19 made it impossible.
