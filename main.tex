    Placed in Northwestern Spain, Santiago de Compostela is the capital city of Galicia.
    The city has its origin in the shrine of Saint James the Great, now the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, as the destination of the Way of St. James, a leading Catholic pilgrimage route since the 9th century.\\[5mm]
    It has about 100 000 inhabitants spread over 220 km${}^2$
    and in 1985, the city's Old Town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

\section{Great city, awesome beamer theme}
\subsection{Motivation}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[default, allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{noframetitle}

Beamer themes are named after some well--known city, and I thought Santiago
deserves one among the best. And here it is!

\begin{itemize}
  \item This theme is built on top of basic latex \texttt{.sty} files that should be compiled with XeLaTeX.
  \item It should be quite easy to customize.
  \item Its main font is Fira Sans, so it must be installed beforehand.
  \item ...
\end{itemize}
